# Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) for Atari Games
#
# How to run:
#
# To train a Neural Network for playing the Atari game Breakout,
# run the following command in a terminal window.
#
# python reinforcement_learning.py --env 'Breakout-v0' --training
#
# The agent should start to improve after a few hours, but a full
# training run required 150 hours on a 2.6 GHz CPU and GTX 1070 GPU.
#
# The hyper-parameters were tuned for Breakout and did not work
# quite as well for SpaceInvaders. Can you find better parameters?
#
# Once the Neural Network has been trained, you can test it and
# watch it play the game by running this command in the terminal:
#
# python reinforcement_learning.py --env 'Breakout-v0' --render --episodes 2
#
# Requirements:
#
# - Python 3.6 (Python 2.7 may not work)
# - TensorFlow 1.1.0
# - OpenAI Gym 0.8.1
#
# Summary:
#
# This program implements a variant of Reinforcement Learning known as
# Q-learning. Imagine that we have an agent that must take actions in
# some environment so as to maximize the cumulative reward over its life.
# The agent sees the state of the game-environment through images
# which are sent through a Neural Network in TensorFlow, so as to
# estimate which action is most likely to maximize the cumulative
# reward of all future actions. These action-values are also called
# Q-values. If the Q-values are known in advance, then the agent merely
# has to select the action corresponding to the highest Q-value in
# each state of the game. But the Q-values are not known in advance
# and must be learnt while the agent is playing the game.
# This is done by initializing all Q-values to zero and then having
# the agent take random actions. Whenever the agent obtains a reward,
# the estimated Q-values can be updated with the new information.
# The agent gradually learns to play the game better and better
# because the Neural Network becomes better at estimating the Q-values.
# But this process is very slow and the basic algorithm implemented
# here typically requires 100 million steps in the game-environment,
# although it will typically start to show improvement much sooner.
#
# Main classes:
#
# - MotionTracer:
#
#   This takes raw images from the game-environment and processes them.
#   The output is called a state and consists of two images of equal size:
#   (1) The last image from the game-environment, resized and gray-scaled.
#   (2) A motion-trace that shows the recent trajectories of objects.
#
# - ReplayMemory:
#
#   Successive image-frames of the game-environment are almost identical.
#   If we train the Neural Network to estimate Q-values from a small
#   number of successive image-frames, then it cannot learn to distinguish
#   important features and the training becomes unstable. For the basic
#   Q-learning algorithm we need many thousand states from the game-environment
#   in order to learn important features so the Q-values can be estimated.
#
# - NeuralNetwork:
#
#   This implements a Neural Network for estimating Q-values. It takes as
#   input a state of the game-environment that was output by the Motion Tracer,
#   and then the Neural Network outputs the estimated Q-values that indicate
#   the cumulative reward of taking each action for a given state of the game.
#
# - Agent:
#
#   This implements the agent that plays games. It loads an Atari-game from
#   OpenAI Gym and inputs the game-images to the Motion Tracer, which in turn
#   outputs a state that is input to the Neural Network, which estimates the
#   Q-values that are used for selecting the next action. The agent then
#   takes a step in the game-environment. During training, the data is added
#   to the Replay Memory and when it is sufficiently full, an optimization run
#   is performed so as to improve the Neural Network's ability to estimate
#   Q-values. This procedure is repeated many, many times until the Neural
#   Network is sufficiently accurate at estimating Q-values.
#
# The Q-Value Formula:
#
# The Q-values for a given state is a vector with a value for each possible
# action, indicating the total future reward that can be had by taking each
# action. The Q-values are initialized to roughly zero and must then be
# improved iteratively when new information becomes available.
#
# We know which action was taken in the current step and what the observed
# reward was, so the estimated Q-value can be improved with this information.
# The Q-value estimates the total cumulative reward for all future steps, which
# is why we use the max Q-value for the next step.
#
# The formula for updating Q-values is implemented in the ReplayMemory-class
# in the function update_all_q_values(), which does a complete backwards-sweep
# through the Replay Memory. The formula for updating the Q-values is:
#
# Q-value for this state and action = observed reward for the current step
#                            + discount factor * max Q-value for next step
#
# The discount factor is a number slightly below 1.0 (e.g. 0.97) which causes
# distant future rewards to have a smaller effect on the Q-values. This means
# that if the reward is the same, then it is considered more valuable to get
# the reward sooner rather than later.
#
# Pseudo-Code:
#
# There are many lines of source-code required to implement all this, but the
# main ideas of the algorithm can be described more simply in pseudo-code:
#
# 1) Initialize all Q-values to roughly zero.
#    We use a Neural Network to estimate the Q-values, so this means
#    we have to initialize the Neural Network with small random weights.
#
# 2) Reset the game-environment and Motion Tracer.
#
# 3) Get the state from the Motion Tracer which consists of two gray-scale
#    images. The first is the image of the game-environment and the second
#    is a motion-trace showing recent movements in the game-environment.
#
# 4) Input the state to the Neural Network to estimate the Q-values.
#
# 5) Either take a random action with probability epsilon, or take the
#    action with the highest Q-value. This is called the epsilon-greedy policy.
#
# 6) Add the state, action and observed reward to the Replay Memory.
#
# 7) When the Replay Memory is sufficiently full, first perform a full
#    backwards-sweep to update all the Q-values with the observed rewards.
#
#    Then perform an optimization run of the Neural Network.
#    This takes random batches of data from the Replay Memory and uses them
#    for training the Neural Network to become better at estimating Q-values.
#
#    Save a checkpoint for the Neural Network so we can reload it later.
#
# 8) Input the recent image of the game-environment to the Motion Tracer
#    and repeat from step (3).

        # Input image:      84 x 84 x 4 (4 gray-scale images of 84 x 84 pixels).
        # Conv layer 1:     16 filters 8 x 8, stride 4, relu.
        # Conv layer 2:     32 filters 4 x 4, stride 2, relu.
        # Fully-conn. 1:    256 units, relu. (Sometimes 512 units).
        # Fully-conn. 2:    num-action units, linear.

        # The DeepMind architecture does a very aggressive downsampling of
        # the input images so they are about 10 x 10 pixels after the final
        # convolutional layer. I found that this resulted in significantly
        # distorted Q-values when using the training method further below.
        # The reason DeepMind could get it working was perhaps that they
        # used a very large replay memory (5x as big as here), and a single
        # optimization iteration was performed after each step of the game,
        # and some more tricks.
