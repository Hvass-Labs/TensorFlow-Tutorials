#
# The Inception Model v3 for TensorFlow.
#
# This is a pre-trained Deep Neural Network for classifying images.
# You provide an image or filename for a jpeg-file which will be
# loaded and input to the Inception model, which will then output
# an array of numbers indicating how likely it is that the
# input-image is of each class.
#
# See the example code at the bottom of this file or in the
# accompanying Python Notebooks.
#
# Tutorial #07 shows how to use the Inception model.
# Tutorial #08 shows how to use it for Transfer Learning.
#
# What is Transfer Learning?
#
# Transfer Learning is the use of a Neural Network for classifying
# images from another data-set than it was trained on. For example,
# the Inception model was trained on the ImageNet data-set using
# a very powerful and expensive computer. But the Inception model
# can be re-used on data-sets it was not trained on without having
# to re-train the entire model, even though the number of classes
# are different for the two data-sets. This allows you to use the
# Inception model on your own data-sets without the need for a
# very powerful and expensive computer to train it.
#
# The last layer of the Inception model before the softmax-classifier
# is called the Transfer Layer because the output of that layer will
# be used as the input in your new softmax-classifier (or as the
# input for another neural network), which will then be trained on
# your own data-set.
#
# The output values of the Transfer Layer are called Transfer Values.
# These are the actual values that will be input to your new
# softmax-classifier or to another neural network that you create.
#
# The word 'bottleneck' is also sometimes used to refer to the
# Transfer Layer or Transfer Values, but it is a confusing word
# that is not used here.
#
# Implemented in Python 3.5 with TensorFlow v0.10.0rc0
