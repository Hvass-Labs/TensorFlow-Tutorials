    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is about a basic form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) called Sentiment Analysis, in which we will try and classify a movie review as either positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple example: \"This movie is not very good.\" This text ends with the words \"very good\" which indicates a very positive sentiment, but it is negated because it is preceded by the word \"not\", so the text should be classified as having a negative sentiment. How can we teach a Neural Network to do this classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is that neural networks cannot work directly on text-data, so we need to convert text into numbers that are compatible with a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another problem is that a text may be arbitrarily long. The neural networks we have worked with in previous tutorials use fixed data-shapes - except for the first dimension of the data which varies with the batch-size. Now we need a type of neural network that can work on both short and long sequences of text.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Flowchart\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem we need several processing steps. First we need to convert the raw text-words into so-called tokens which are integer values. These tokens are really just indices into a list of the entire vocabulary. Then we convert these integer-tokens into so-called embeddings which are real-valued vectors, whose mapping will be trained along with the neural network, so as to map words with similar meanings to similar embedding-vectors. Then we input these embedding-vectors to a Recurrent Neural Network which can take sequences of arbitrary length as input and output a kind of summary of what it has seen in the input. This output is then squashed using a Sigmoid-function to give us a value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is taken to mean a negative sentiment and 1.0 means a positive sentiment. This whole process allows us to classify input-text as either having a negative or positive sentiment.\n",

    "## Recurrent Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic building block in a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a Recurrent Unit (RU). There are many different variants of recurrent units such as the rather clunky LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) and the somewhat simpler GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) which we will use in this tutorial. Experiments in the literature suggest that the LSTM and GRU have roughly similar performance. Even simpler variants also exist and the literature suggests that they may perform even better than both LSTM and GRU, but they are not implemented in Keras which we will use in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows the abstract idea of a recurrent unit, which has an internal state that is being updated every time the unit receives a new input. This internal state serves as a kind of memory. However, it is not a traditional kind of computer memory which stores bits that are either on or off. Instead the recurrent unit stores floating-point values in its memory-state, which are read and written using matrix-operations so the operations are all differentiable. This means the memory-state can store arbitrary floating-point values (although typically limited between -1.0 and 1.0) and the network can be trained like a normal neural network using Gradient Descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new state-value depends on both the old state-value and the current input. For example, if the state-value has memorized that we have recently seen the word \"not\" and the current input is \"good\" then we need to store a new state-value that memorizes \"not good\" which indicates a negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the recurrent unit that is responsible for mapping old state-values and inputs to the new state-value is called a gate, but it is really just a type of matrix-operation. There is another gate for calculating the output-values of the recurrent unit. The implementation of these gates vary for different types of recurrent units. This figure merely shows the abstract idea of a recurrent unit. The LSTM has more gates than the GRU but some of them are apparently redundant so they can be omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the recurrent unit, we must gradually change the weight-matrices of the gates so the recurrent unit gives the desired output for an input sequence. This is done automatically in TensorFlow.\n",

    "### Unrolled Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to visualize and understand a Recurrent Neural Network is to \"unroll\" the recursion. In this figure there is only a single recurrent unit denoted RU, which will receive a text-word from the input sequence in a series of time-steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial memory-state of the RU is reset to zero internally by Keras / TensorFlow every time a new sequence begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first time-step the word \"this\" is input to the RU which uses its internal state (initialized to zero) and its gate to calculate the new state. The RU also uses its other gate to calculate the output but it is ignored here because it is only needed at the end of the sequence to output a kind of summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second time-step the word \"is\" is input to the RU which now uses the internal state that was just updated from seeing the previous word \"this\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not much meaning in the words \"this is\" so the RU probably doesn't save anything important in its internal state from seeing these words. But when it sees the third word \"not\" the RU has learned that it may be important for determining the overall sentiment of the input-text, so it needs to be stored in the memory-state of the RU, which can be used later when the RU sees the word \"good\" in time-step 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally when the entire sequence has been processed, the RU outputs a vector of values that summarizes what it has seen in the input sequence. We then use a fully-connected layer with a Sigmoid activation to get a single value between 0.0 and 1.0 which we interpret as the sentiment either being negative (values close to 0.0) or positive (values close to 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the sake of clarity, this figure doesn't show the mapping from text-words to integer-tokens and embedding-vectors, as well as the fully-connected Sigmoid layer on the output.\n",

    "### 3-Layer Unrolled Network\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use a Recurrent Neural Network with 3 recurrent units (or layers) denoted RU1, RU2 and RU3 in the \"unrolled\" figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer is much like the unrolled figure above for a single-layer RNN. First the recurrent unit RU1 has its internal state initialized to zero by Keras / TensorFlow. Then the word \"this\" is input to RU1 and it updates its internal state. Then it processes the next word \"is\", and so forth. But instead of outputting a single summary value at the end of the sequence, we use the output of RU1 for every time-step. This creates a new sequence that can then be used as input for the next recurrent unit RU2. The same process is repeated for the second layer and this creates a new output sequence which is then input to the third layer's recurrent unit RU3, whose final output is passed to a fully-connected Sigmoid layer that outputs a value between 0.0 (negative sentiment) and 1.0 (positive sentiment).\n",

    "### Exploding & Vanishing Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the weights for the gates inside the recurrent unit, we need to minimize some loss-function which measures the difference between the actual output of the network relative to the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the \"unrolled\" figures above we see that the reccurent units are applied recursively for each word in the input sequence. This means the recurrent gate is applied once for each time-step. The gradient-signals have to flow back from the loss-function all the way to the first time the recurrent gate is used. If the gradient of the recurrent gate is multiplicative, then we essentially have an exponential function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use texts that have more than 500 words. This means the RU's gate for updating its internal memory-state is applied recursively more than 500 times. If a gradient of just 1.01 is multiplied with itself 500 times then it gives a value of about 145. If a gradient of just 0.99 is multiplied with itself 500 times then it gives a value of about 0.007. These are called exploding and vanishing gradients. The only gradients that can survive recurrent multiplication are 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these so-called exploding and vanishing gradients, care must be made when designing the recurrent unit and its gates. That is why the actual implementation of the GRU is more complicated, because it tries to send the gradient back through the gates without this distortion."

       "'I would like to start by saying I can only hope that the makers of this movie and it\\'s sister film The Intruder (directed by the great unheralded stylist auteur that is Jopi Burnama) know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of Jarrow.<br /><br />From the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a motorbike, the pitiless destruction of a silence lab, the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anaemic bad guys in movie history and costume design that Jean Paul Gautier would find ott and garish. Make no mistake; this is a truly unique experience. Early highlight - an explosion (get used to it, plenty more where that came from!) followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word \"dad\" in living memory. And then... the theme song...<br /><br />Yeah, this deserves its own paragraph. Sung by AJ, written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous, it makes the songs written for the Rocky films sound like Schubert. This is crap 80\\'s hero motivation narcissism at an all time high, with choice lyrics such as \"its only me and you, its come down to the wire\" and much talk of having to \"cross the line\" (it\\'ll make sense in time - our hero cares little for the boundaries of bona fida police work) abounding. Not to mention the Indonesian Supremes cooing the film\\'s title seductively. At this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse.<br /><br />Our hero is Semitic cop Peter Goldson (essayed brilliantly by Intruder star Peter O\\'Brien), the \"stabilizer\" of the title. The man\\'s bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than inconspicuous undercover work truly leaves much to be desired, but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown Jakarta, with local sleaze ball connection Captain Johnny in tow, as well as Peter\\'s own waste of space partner in fashion crime Sylvia Nash, who does little. So many highlights, so little time - the \"slide please\" arrogance of Peter\\'s not all too convincingly argued case against chief baddie Greg Rainmaker (Intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard Craig Gavin as the monstrous John White - helluva name eh? No! Oh well...), the x marks the spot location map stupidity, our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine Tina Probost during a moment of weakness on her behalf, the latter turning up at a sting operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing troop. And believe me that barely covers it.<br /><br />There wasn\\'t even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride. Or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on Boogie Nights. Or the absolutely hysterical craic between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy shtick than these clowns. The trowel was possibly too subtle me thinks.<br /><br />Ah it tails off people, and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring, but the character interaction is stupendous, the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing. Oh and the shoes people - watch out for the shoes!'"

    "This tutorial showed the basic methods for doing Natural Language Processing (NLP) using a Recurrent Neural Network with integer-tokens and an embedding layer. This was used to do sentiment analysis of movie reviews from IMDB. It works reasonably well if the hyper-parameters are chosen properly. But it is important to understand that this is not human-like comprehension of text. The system does not have any real understanding of the text. It is just a clever way of doing pattern-recognition."

    "* Increase the size of the embedding-vectors to e.g. 200. Does it affect performance?\n",
    "* Try varying all the different hyper-parameters for the Recurrent Neural Network.\n",
    "* Use Bayesian Optimization from Tutorial #19 to find the best choice of hyper-parameters.\n",
    "* Use 'post' for padding and truncating in `pad_sequences()`. Does it affect the performance?\n",
    "* Use individual characters instead of tokenized words as the vocabulary. You can then use one-hot encoded vectors for each character instead of using the embedding-layer.\n",
    "* Use `model.fit_generator()` instead of `model.fit()` and make your own data-generator, which creates a batch of data using a random subset of `x_train_tokens`. The sequences must be padded so they all match the length of the longest sequence.\n",
